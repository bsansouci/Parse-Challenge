#Parse Challenge

**The challenge was the following**:

You are given a certain number of words, that will become part of a dictionary. You then receive an encrypted word from that dictionary and you need to decrypt it. The encryption is a very basic cipher encryption, a 1 to 1 mapping between characters.
Example:

>bob

>lol

>obviously

>//secret

>121 214526789 828

The output of your program should be, for this example:
>121 214526789 828 = bob obviously lol

You have 2 hours (no really, you only have 2 hours)

If you are interested, you should really try this challenge, you'll find that it's not that easy.
Here is my solution.

I created the code generator.js in order to generate random dictionaries and random strings. You can use it to try out your solution. You can just look at the example in the file.
